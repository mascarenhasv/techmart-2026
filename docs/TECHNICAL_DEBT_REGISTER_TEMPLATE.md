For each technical debt item you identify:
1. Give it a unique ID (TD-001, TD-002, etc.)
2. Describe what the problem is
3. Note where it's located (file and line numbers)
4. Assess the **Impact** (High/Medium/Low)
5. Assess the **Effort** to fix (High/Medium/Low)
6. Calculate **Priority** (see matrix below)
7. Describe what the remediation would involve (not implementing it, just planning)
